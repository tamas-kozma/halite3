* Map divided into two sets of finer and coarser grids
** The sets are aligned so that the corners of one are the centers of the other
*** I can then use the set where the boat in question is closer to the middle, to get better accuracy
** For each boat, use the grids so that the finer ones are used near the ship, and the coarser further away
** For outbound harvesters, far away resources are visible, but only with very little weight
*** This way they will use them if, and only if, there's nothing closer
* Roles
** Special agent
** Outbound
** Harverster
** Inbound
* Defence
** Ignore enemies close by, but account for new bases
** When blocked for at least two turns, then I can employ one of a number of tactics, depending on class, distance, opponent positions
*** With a chance, inverted goal assignment, for a number of turns
*** Crash with enemy
* Entrance and exit routes
* Calculate ship-turns (mandays) for all players, sum up resources
** Without building anything, with only a ship, with a ship then a base, with a base then a ship
** Then choose the best
* Ship command ordering and resource adjustments
** Special agents first
** Harversters
*** Harversters should reduce resources around them
** Outbound
*** Outbound should reduce at the target area, and should evaluate so that the ones closer to their goals come first
** Inbound
* Random
** For inbound traffic, some cells should be off limits around exit routes
** When deciding that a base should be built, that should be taken into account immediately for inbound ships
** Bases with more resources around them could be preferred drop off points
*** But then inbound ships might have to sail through lots of halite and loose their cargo
*** Maybe I should clear paths to new bases, or send empty ships there first?
** Ship-turn-resource calculations can also give me an idea about how well I'm doing compared to opponents
*** If all is well, then no need to use any tricks
*** Otherwise I might want to start experimenting against the strongest enemies
*** It is also possible that I decide to build a base even if that is not good for me, as long as that costs more to an enemy ahead of me
*** I can also use this when deciding where to build a base maybe
** Avoid collisions by not entering cells where enemies might also go
*** I can check if the enemy that could go there is currently on a cell that has not much lower resource count and then ignore it
** Outbound ships should prefer resources closer to enemies (enemy bases), as that way I can steal resources from them
*** Maybe only enemies that are doing well compared to me, as harvesting with them could be bad for me
*** But it can also be good because of the inspiration they provide, so this needs to be tested
** Harvesters should slightly prefer cells closer to the base
** I need to get between the enemy ship and base, and then I can either torpedo or block the enemy well
* New random
** Resources need penalty both for distance from ship and for distance from bases
*** That will likely get outbound ships to go to new bases, as resources around them will have low distance from base penalties
** Inbound ships need to find efficient paths
*** Start from bases, set distance and cost at neighbouring cells, taking the minimum of the new value and any old value
*** Ignore neighbours where the distance is much greater than the direct distance would be (10%?)
*** Think some more about this, as I have a doubt that this algorithm is not correct, at least not without some ordering
** Resources along paths where inbound ships go should get bonuses
*** That should help build roads
*** The paths need to be detected by scent left by inbound ships traveling them
* Harvest planning map issues
** Going between two rich areas, because halfway between them the ship is closer to both
***	Mitigated by using squared distance penalties
** If using multiple rings, then a more distance ring can reach a local maximum before the closer ring can take over
*** Maybe fixed by rings that overlap enough, but then there will be too many source cells to calculate with
** If using information from all of the map in a single plan, then local variation will hide distant smells
*** Find a magical function that somehow fixes this, or use multiple rings
** Screw all that
*** I can just use the flooding local maxima approach instead and avoid all the above (but we'll see what other problems appear then)
* Some more random
** Maybe outbound ships should also travel on low halite routes to not waste halite?
